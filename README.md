# Decision Tree and Markov Model for Cervical Cancer Screening 
## Cost Utility Analysis (Pap vs. Self Sampled HPV DNA)

 - Decision Tree values were used for the starting states in the Markov Decision Process
 - Markov Model built with heemod package: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.03252.pdf

### Files
- 'final project_v1.R' --> markov model
- 'decision tree final.R' --> decision tree
- 'By age Transition Probabilities.xlsx' --> inputs for markov model

#### To Run:
1. run Decision tree first with specified probabilities to update the inputs for the markov model
2. run markov model file
